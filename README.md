## Overveiw
This project was developed as part of my application to the Steer Elite Internship Program. It is a strategy-based game featuring two opposing teams: the Red Team and the Blue Team.

The Red Team is procedurally generated each match, creating a new challenge every time. In response, the player is tasked with assembling the Blue Team by strategically selecting characters or units from a roster to form the most effective lineup possible to counter and defeat the Red Team.

The gameplay and architecture were built using the ECS pattern to promote modularity, scalability, and performance — aligning with modern game development standards and Steer’s expectations.
