## 🧠 Overview

**Battle Simulator** was developed as part of my application to the **Steer Elite Internship Program**.  
It is a strategy-based simulation game featuring two opposing factions:

- **Red Team**: Procedurally generated each match, creating unique and unpredictable challenges.
- **Blue Team**: Assembled by the player using a roster of available units to strategically counter the Red Team.

The game is designed with **Unity’s Entity Component System (ECS)** to promote:

- 🧩 Modularity  
- 📈 Scalability  
- 🚀 High Performance

These principles align with modern game architecture standards and Steer’s technical expectations.
