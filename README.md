## Overview
This strategy game was developed for my Steer Elite Internship application. Each match features a procedurally generated Red Team, challenging the player to build a countering Blue Team from a roster of units. Built with the ECS pattern, the game emphasizes modularity, scalability, and performance to meet modern development standards.
